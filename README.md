# Warcraft Survivors

A free, fan-made survivors game built from Warcraft III. Pick one of 24 heroes, walk into a
zone and survive ten minutes of ever-growing hordes. Your spells cast themselves; you move,
dodge, collect experience and choose a level-up card each level. Every two minutes a boss
arrives, and at 10:00 the zone's final boss.

It runs on [OpenRealm](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm), an open-source C
reimplementation of the Warcraft III engine, with the art, models, sounds and music of your
own Warcraft III install. The same script also runs as a custom map in Warcraft III Reforged.

## Features

- **24 heroes** from the five factions of The Frozen Throne: Alliance, Horde, Undead, Night Elf
  and the Tavern. Each hero has its four Warcraft III abilities, reworked for a survivors game
  (Blizzard, Bladestorm, Feral Spirit, Starfall, Inferno...), and you choose which one it starts
  with. Each faction adds its own trait.
- **Level-up cards** in World of Warcraft rarities, from Common to Legendary: a new spell (four
  slots), a higher rank for one you have, or a blessing (damage, haste, area, spell duration...).
  **Nothing has a rank limit.** Reroll and banish cards you do not want.
- **Summons that pile up**: water elementals, spirit wolves, skeletons, treants, infernals and
  more each last one cooldown; raise your spell duration and the waves overlap into an army.
- **12 zones**: Ashenvale, Westfall, Tirisfal Glades, The Barrens, Stranglethorn Vale,
  Plaguelands, Alterac Valley, Felwood, Dalaran, Hellfire Peninsula, The Black Temple and
  Northrend, each with its own army of creeps and faction units (Scarlet Crusade, Frostwolf
  Horde, Gurubashi trolls, Fel Horde, naga...), four bosses and a final boss. Win a zone to open
  the next.
- **Difficulties**: Normal, Heroic, Mythic and Mythic+, with keystone levels that never end.
- **Between runs**: gear dropped by bosses (Armory), talents bought with gold, 25 achievements
  and their rewards, and a Codex of every spell and blessing.
- A damage meter, floating damage numbers, rebindable keys, mouse or keyboard movement, and
  separate volume for music, spells, units and ambience.

## Playing

### In your browser

Open **[warcraftsurvivor.para-bellum.eu](https://warcraftsurvivor.para-bellum.eu)** in a recent
Chromium browser on a computer: Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave or Vivaldi. Firefox and Safari are
untested. The first visit downloads about 200 mb of game data into the browser; later
visits start in a few seconds. Progress is saved in that browser only, not online: another
browser or computer starts fresh, and clearing the site's data erases it.

### On Windows

You need **Warcraft III 1.29 (Legacy) with The Frozen Throne**, installed from your own copy.
Reforged's data does not work with the standalone engine.

#### Download

*Coming soon.* The game is still in development; for now, build it from source (below).
The download will be a small `WarcraftSurvivors.exe` (about 4 MB) on the Releases page: it
unpacks the game and asks once where Warcraft III 1.29 is installed. Progress is saved in
`%APPDATA%\warcraft-3\CustomMapData\WarcraftSurvivors\`.

#### Build from source

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). In the **UCRT64** shell, install the toolchain:
   ```sh
   pacman -S make diffutils mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2 \
             mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libepoxy
   ```
2. Clone this repository, and the engine fork into `engine/`:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Willios/Warcraft-3-Mod-survivor
   cd Warcraft-3-Mod-survivor
   git clone -b survivor https://github.com/Willios/open-realm-williosfork engine
   ```
3. Build the engine from `engine/`:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-windows.ps1 -Jobs 8
   ```
4. Copy `src\*.lua` and `src\art\*.tga` into `engine\dist\windows\share\warcraft-3\Scripts\Survivor\`.
5. Start `engine\dist\windows\play_survivor.bat` (it expects Warcraft III in
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III (Legacy)`; edit the path if yours is elsewhere).

#### Build the browser version

The engine fork also builds to WebAssembly (Emscripten 4.0.21). From `engine/`, in Git Bash:

1. `bash port/web/build-survivor.sh` builds the page into `build/web/survivor/` (the scripts in
   `src/` are packed into `index.wasm`).
2. `python port/web/make_survivor_data.py "<your Warcraft III 1.29 folder>" build/web/survivor`
   adds the game data the page downloads on a first visit.
3. `python port/web/stage_survivor_upload.py build/web/survivor build/web/survivor-upload`
   gathers what goes on the web server, with an `.htaccess` for Apache.

The server must use HTTPS and send `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` (the `.htaccess` does it). To try it locally:
`python port/web/serve.py --directory build/web/survivor`.

`CLAUDE.md` has the detailed developer notes: every engine change, test aids, known issues.

### Warcraft III Reforged

Open `map/WarcraftSurvivor.w3m` in the World Editor, set Scenario > Map Options > Script
Language to Lua, and paste `src/ashenvale_survivor.lua` into the map's Custom Script Code.
The file must never contain a percent sign: the editor crashes on save.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/ashenvale_survivor.lua` | The whole game: lobby, heroes, spells, zones, HUD, saves |
| `src/engine_boot.lua` | Entry point for the standalone engine (menu map, zone arenas) |
| `src/art/` | Lobby title art |
| `map/` | The Reforged map |
| `tools/smoketest/` | Runs the script against mocked natives: `python tools/smoketest/run.py` (needs `pip install lupa`) |
| `tools/engine_tests/` | Test scripts for the standalone engine |
| `tools/release/` | Builds the Windows download |
| `docs/screenshots/` | The pictures above |
| `engine/` | Not in this repository: the [OpenRealm fork](https://github.com/Willios/open-realm-williosfork/tree/survivor) is cloned here |

## How it works

Warcraft III maps are driven by scripts that call the game's natives (`CreateUnit`,
`AddSpecialEffect`, `BlzCreateFrame`...). Warcraft Survivors is one Lua script written against
those natives, so the same file runs in Reforged and in OpenRealm. Everything on screen, from
the lobby to the cards and the HUD, is built at runtime from the game's own textures, icons
and models: the script imports nothing.

The `survivor` branch of the engine adds what the script needs: a Lua 5.4 host that maps Lua
calls onto the engine's JASS natives, the Reforged UI-frame and keyboard natives, preload
files for saves, and fixes found along the way. The arenas are official melee maps, one per
zone with a matching tileset (12 zones, from Moonglade for Ashenvale to IceCrown for Northrend),
with the creep camps removed.

## Game data and legal

This repository contains **no Blizzard game files**: no MPQ archives, models, textures,
sounds, music or maps. The game reads them at runtime from your own Warcraft III install.
The screenshots show Blizzard's art, rendered from such an install. The browser version is
hosted separately, with the game data it needs; none of it is in this repository.
